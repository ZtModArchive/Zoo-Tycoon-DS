RED KANGAROO 
Foxes and eagles prey on very young kangaroos.  
Dingoes prey on young and adult alike. Because of  
the damage they can do to crops, kangaroos are  
considered pests and are destroyed accordingly. Red  
kangaroos are also commercially hunted for skins  
and meat. This animal is considered a threatened  
species.
