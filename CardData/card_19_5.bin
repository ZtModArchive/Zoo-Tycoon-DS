BLACK BEAR 
common. 
 
Female bears are very protective of their young. Cubs  
who stray from their mother's side may fall victim to  
adult male bears or wolves. Other predators of bear  
cubs include bobcats, eagles, mountain lions, and  
feral dog packs. 
};
Adult black bears are preyed upon by grizzly bears,  
wolves, and humans. In North America, an estimated  
30,000 black bears are killed annually by hunters.  
However, in spite of these losses, and although much  
of its historical habitat has been destroyed, the black  
bear population today is thriving.
