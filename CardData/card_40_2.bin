As the terrain of Arctic wolves is both inhospitable 
and inaccessible, little is known about their behavior 
in the wild, especially during the long, dark winter 
months. Even the vast majority of Inuit live further 
south than the Arctic wolf. Research conducted 
during the summer indicates that much of the Arctic 
wolf's behavior is the same as that of its southern 
cousin. Pack solidarity among Arctic wolves seems 
greater, probably due to the fact that a lone wolf is 
unlikely to survive in this environment. In the wild, 
the Arctic wolf generally lives about seven years, 
whereas in captivity, it can live over 17 years.

Arctic wolves will eat any animal that they can catch:
