MARKHOR 
of Asian medicine provides a profitable market for  
markhor horns.   Other human threats to the  
markhor include loss of habitat and competition from  
domestic livestock.   As a result, markhor herds are  
generally quite small in size, averaging about nine  
animals.   A herd contains mostly adult females and  
young, with one or more adult males. 
 
The markhor's primary predators, apart from  
humans, are wolves, leopards, and snow leopards.
