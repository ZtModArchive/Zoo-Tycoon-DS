RED KANGAROO 
as long as 29 feet. Kangaroos will run from danger,  
rather than fight, although a large claw attached to  
their hind leg makes them quite dangerous at close  
quarters. The kangaroo's long, heavy tail provides  
balance and support.  
 
Red kangaroos are shy, alert creatures, docile except  
when cornered. To warn their mob of impending  
danger, these animals will thump on the ground.  
Hearing this warning, joeys will jump back into their  
mothers' pouches. Although males will not defend the  
members of their mob from attack, they will fight  
each other for breeding rights. The two boomers will  
attempt to push each other off balance by jabbing or  
locking forearms. Sometimes they will lean back on  
their tails and kick each other in the belly with their  
powerful hind feet.
