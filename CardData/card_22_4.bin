GRIZZLY BEAR 
Alaska, salmon is an important food source.  
 
Except for mating and caring for the young, grizzly  
bears lead fairly solitary lives, although they will  
gather along streams with other grizzlies when  
salmon are spawning. Like polar and black bears,  
grizzlies mate early in the summer, and the embryos  
do not implant until the female is ready to begin her  
winter hibernation. Mother grizzlies give birth while  
asleep, and the tiny newborns will begin nursing on  
their own. By spring, when the mother is ready to  
leave the den, the cubs will weigh around 20 pounds.  
A grizzly may give birth to between one and three  
cubs, usually two. Cubs stay with their mother for  
about a year and then ease into independence.  
 
The adult grizzly has no enemies or predators,
