THOMSON'S GAZELLE 
Gazelles rely on visual displays and odors rather  
than on sound to communicate, and so are quieter  
than other animals. Angry gazelles can be seen  
rearing up, bucking, and stamping their feet. As with  
other highly social animals, one angry gazelle can  
often upset the rest of the herd. A happy gazelle can  
often be seen running and jumping around its exhibit,  
or just lying contentedly in the sun. 
 
These animals reproduce well in captivity.
