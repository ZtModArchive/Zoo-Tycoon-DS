POLAR BEAR
Polar bears are found in all the northern polar 
regions, which include parts of Russia, Norway, 
Greenland, Canada, and Alaska. Polar bears have 
enormous ranges, traveling an average of 5,500 miles 
a year or 15 miles a day.

Polar bears are genetically very similar to brown bears,
and are considered to be their direct descendants. 
It is believed that a population of brown bears was 
cut off by glacial movement during the Pleistocene 
era. Rather than dying out, they instead adapted to 
the harsh arctic environment.

Despite appearances, a polar bear's fur is not white. 
Each hair is actually colorless and transparent with 
a hollow core. Polar bears look white because the 
hollow core scatters and reflects visible light.
