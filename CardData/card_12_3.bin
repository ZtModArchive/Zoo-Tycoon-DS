by competing predators, such as lions, tigers, or  
packs of hyenas. They hide among branches in order

leopard will stash a kill high up in a tree in order to  
protect it from other predators. This allows a leopard

probably a significant factor in the relative success of  
the leopard among large cats. Leopards are capable  
of climbing a tree while dragging a carcass up to  
three times its own weight, such as an adult male

even in the dark. Leopards depend upon stealth,
