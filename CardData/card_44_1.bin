SALTWATER CROCODILE
The saltwater crocodile, or @salty,@ is the largest 
living reptile in the world. In rare cases, males can 
reach lengths of up to 23 feet, although lengths of 13 
feet are average. Females are smaller and do not 
normally exceed 10 feet. This crocodile has a large 
head, a broad, rounded snout, and a heavy set of jaws 
lined with cone-shaped teeth. The skin of mature 
adults is generally dark, with lighter tan or gray 
areas and cream-colored bellies. 

Saltwater crocodiles are designed for an aquatic 
environment, possessing clear eyelids that enable 
them to see underwater, flaps of skin that keep water 
out of their throat and ears, and webbed rear feet 
that aid in swimming. Like all reptiles, salties are 
cold-blooded. After basking in the sun, they must 
return to the water to cool off. A saltwater crocodile
