LOWLAND GORILLA 
silverback and a number of females and offspring.  
Lowland gorillas have an undeserved reputation for  
being ferocious. In reality, they are gentle creatures  
who rarely fight among themselves or with other  
species. If the group is threatened, the silverback  
leader will respond by roaring and beating his chest.  
However, this behavior is seldom followed through  
with an attack. Gorillas show moderate aggression or  
annoyance by staring with their heads down,  
eyebrows lowered, and lips pursed. 
 
Gorillas generally do not walk upright, except when  
engaged in threat displays. Instead, they walk on all  
fours, using the knuckles on their hands. Each hand  
has four long fingers and an opposable thumb.  
Lowland gorillas, even the mature males, will climb  
trees.
