ARCTIC WOLF
The Arctic wolf is a subspecies of the gray wolf. Arctic 
wolves have white coats, which are thicker than the 
coats of southern wolves. Their ears are smaller and 
more rounded, their muzzles are slightly shorter, and 
their legs are noticeably shorter. They are also 
heavier in build, with a full-grown male weighing as 
much as 175 pounds.

Arctic wolves live on the islands of the Canadian 
Arctic and on the northern coast of Greenland, 
roughly north of 70° North latitude. They inhabit a 
harsh world comprised of tundra, glacier valleys, and 
ice fields. The ground in these regions is permanently 
frozen. Arctic wolves are able to endure temperatures 
as low as -70° F. Due to its isolation, this wolf is the 
purest of all the wolf breeds.
