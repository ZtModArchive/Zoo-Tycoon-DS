SALTWATER CROCODILE
will also lie with its mouth open to release excess 
heat. 

This reptile is the direct descendent of the 
archosaurs, an intelligent species of dinosaur that 
dominated the earth during the Mesozoic Era. In 
addition to a large Australian population, smaller 
populations exist in China, the Indian sub-continent, 
and Southeast Asia. Individuals have been found far 
from their usual range, as they are able to travel long 
distances by sea. This seafaring ability helps to 
explain their wide distribution. 

These crocodiles are commonly found in the brackish 
water around coastal areas and in tidal rivers. They 
can also be found in the open sea or inland in 
freshwater rivers, swamps, and billabongs.
