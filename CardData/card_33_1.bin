GIANT ANTEATER 
Giant anteaters are primarily found in the  
savannahs and grasslands of Central and South  
America. These animals are gray with distinctive  
black and white markings, and their narrow bodies  
are about the size of a large dog. Anteaters are  
covered in coarse hair, which helps to protect them  
from insect bites. Anteaters lack teeth and their jaws  
can only open half an inch. Their chief distinguishing  
characteristic is an extremely long, cylindrical snout,  
which the anteater thrusts directly into ant and  
termite colonies when searching for food.   
 
Anteaters are efficient eaters, with long sticky  
tongues that can flick in and out of their mouths at a  
rate of up to 160 times a minute. They can consume  
up to 30,000 insects a day. Giant anteaters get most  
of the water they need from the insects they consume.
