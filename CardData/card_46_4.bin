UNICORN
remove its horn. Invariably, without its horn, a 
unicorn will die.

Unicorns are strong, intelligent and proud animals, 
and are impossible to domesticate. They are fierce 
when cornered, and are quick to defend themselves 
with their lance-like horns. Apart from humans, the 
unicorn's only natural enemy is the lion.

Unicorns are among the most difficult creatures to 
keep in captivity, given their fiercely independent 
natures. A unicorn enclosure should be designed to 
provide the animal with lots of space and privacy. 
They require a forest habitat with lots of vegetation 
for browsing.
