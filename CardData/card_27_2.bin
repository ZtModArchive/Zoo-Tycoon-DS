OKAPI 
nature, its relative scarcity, its nocturnal habit, its  
keen sense of smell and hearing, and its speed at  
making getaways-all combine to make the okapi a  
difficult animal to study in the wild. Discovered in  
1901, this animal was the last large land animal to  
be found by Europeans. Okapis are still rare in zoos.  
 
Okapis are herbivores, feeding on grass, fruit, new  
growth, and leaves in the wild. Their zoo diet consists  
of hay, grain, and browse. The okapi's extremely long  
and sticky tongue not only enables it to easily strip  
leaves and twigs off branches, but also allows it to  
groom itself thoroughly. They can even reach their  
eyes and ears using their tongues! The okapi's clean  
habits are a big help to zookeepers: when an okapi  
needs medication, the keeper will pour it over the  
animal's back, and the okapi will immediately lick it
