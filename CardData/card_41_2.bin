EMPEROR PENGUIN
penguins have been known to take larger fish and 
even squid. 

Penguins are among the most social of all birds. 
Penguin colonies, or rookeries, may contain 
thousands of individuals. They will use rocks for 
diving and for congregating. Emperor penguins swim, 
feed, and dive together, even at sea. The group offers 
its members protection against hunger and cold. If a 
penguin is too warm, it holds its flippers away from 
its body, so both surfaces of the flippers are exposed 
to air, releasing heat.

When penguins are hungry, they will often start 
walking together in large groups. People enjoy 
watching the comical gait and head movements of 
penguins, as they awkwardly waddle about on land
