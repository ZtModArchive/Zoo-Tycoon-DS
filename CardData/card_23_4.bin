each other by scent marking, facial and body  
language, and vocalizations. Howling helps them  
keep track of each other, establish territories,  
assemble the pack, and defend a kill. They may also  
howl just for enjoyment. On a calm night, howls can  
be heard from as far away as 120 miles.  
 
In addition to a finely developed sense of hearing,  
wolves have a keen sense of smell and are capable of  
detecting prey more than a mile away. Wolves are  
carnivores and will normally hunt as a pack. Gray  
wolves will hunt large animals such as moose and  
deer. Wolves can help to keep a prey population  
robust by eliminating the old, sick, weak, or injured  
animals. The loss of wolves in the wild has led to the  
overpopulation of certain species. Wolves will also eat  
beaver, rabbits, and even mice.
