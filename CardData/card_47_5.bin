ASIAN ELEPHANT
Historically, their intelligence, strength, dexterity, 
and ability to navigate difficult terrain have made 
elephants ideal working animals. They have been 
used for transport and logging, and as war steeds and 
circus performers. Nowadays, many of their 
traditional roles have been phased out, leaving many 
of the domesticated animals without a means of 
support. In the wild, due to poaching and habitat 
destruction, Asian elephants have become an 
endangered species, with an estimate of fewer than 
30,000 individuals remaining.
