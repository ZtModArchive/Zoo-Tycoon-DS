to a dry, hot climate. Rather than cooling its body 
through perspiration when the air temperature 
increases, the gemsbok's body temperature will rise 
as well. After several hours, the gemsbok's body will 
radiate this excess heat. Should their bodies reach 
too high a temperature, the gemsbok may cool off by 
panting. Its kidneys and circulatory system are also 
adapted for water conservation and heat regulation. 
Gemsbok can endure temperatures ranging from 99-
