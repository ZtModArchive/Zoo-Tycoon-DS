LOWLAND GORILLA 
Gorillas are the largest primates, weighing up to 400  
pounds. There are three subspecies of gorillas: the  
eastern lowland gorilla, the western lowland gorilla,  
and the mountain gorilla. The eastern lowland gorilla  
is endangered, with a population of only 3,000 to  
8,000 individuals. Although the western lowland gorilla 
is the most numerous of the subspecies, its survival 
is still threatened, and only a few hundred  
mountain gorillas remain. The eastern lowland  
gorilla is blacker in color than the mountain gorilla  
and has shorter hair, a longer face, and a broader  
chest than the western lowland gorilla. In all three  
subspecies, the male gorillas develop silver backs as  
they mature.  
 
The eastern lowland gorilla dwells in small pockets of  
tropical rainforest in the eastern part of the Congo.
