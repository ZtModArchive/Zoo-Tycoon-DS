CLOUDED LEOPARD 
leopards during the day. 
 
It is assumed that clouded leopards, like most cats,  
are solitary in nature, apart from breeding pairs and  
a mother with young. However, little is actually  
known about the social behavior of these animals.  
This lack of knowledge has probably contributed to  
the fact that clouded leopards are among the most  
difficult cats to breed in captivity. In the past, when  
adult cats were introduced to each other for breeding  
purposes, fighting would ensue, sometimes leading to  
the death of the female. The current practice is to put  
pairs together when they are less than one year of  
age, which has been more successful. Litter size in  
the wild generally ranges from one to five, with two  
or three being average.
