AFRICAN WARTHOG 
They are most commonly found in small family  
groups, called sounders, consisting of one or more  
adult females and their young. Single adult males  
will sometimes join these sounders. Warthogs like to  
lie in contact with each other and will engage in  
social grooming using their snouts and incisors.  
 
Apart from predators, warthogs are indifferent to  
most other savannah animals, going about their  
business in relative peace. They have a symbiotic  
relationship with birds such as the yellow hornbill,  
which they allow to eat the parasites living on their  
bodies. Warthogs will also wallow intensively,  
covering their bodies with mud, both in an attempt to  
get rid of these bothersome parasites and to cool  
themselves off in hot weather.
