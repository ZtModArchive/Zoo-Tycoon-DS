EMPEROR PENGUIN
Female emperor penguins lay their eggs, and then 
head out to sea to feed for up to 60 days. During this 
period, the male stands awaiting her return, with the 
egg, covered by a loose piece of skin called the brood 
flap, balanced on his feet. During this incubation 
period, the father penguin can lose up to half his body 
weight.
