SIBERIAN TIGER 
many Siberian tigers in captivity as there are free. It  
is estimated that there are only between 150 and 430  
Siberian tigers still living in the wild. 
 
Tigers have no relationship with other animals,  
except as a source of food. A Siberian tiger will eat  
just about anything it can catch, including wild boar,  
deer, elk, lynx, bears, badgers, and hares. It will also  
catch salmon and other fish. Usually, only one out of  
ten hunting trips is successful. To sustain itself in its  
cold habitat, this animal needs to eat over 20 pounds  
of meat a day. It is capable of eating 70 pounds of  
meat in a single night. In captivity, Siberian tigers  
eat a steady diet of enriched horsemeat, bones, and  
dry foods. Tigers become quite upset (and loud) when  
they do not receive an adequate supply of food.
