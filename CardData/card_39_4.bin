months. If the mother bear stores enough fat 
reserves to support a pregnancy, the embryo will then 
attach itself to the uterus and continue growing. 
Pregnant polar bear females are the only polar bears 
that hibernate for a long period. Cubs (usually two) 
are born in December or January while the mother is 
still sleeping. Newborn polar bear cubs are blind, 
hairless and very small-pproximately the size of a 
chipmunk. They are able to move just enough to 
begin nursing, as their mother continues to sleep. By 
the time the mother is ready to leave the den in the 
spring, the cubs will have grown to over 20 pounds 
and are able to accompany her. The cubs will 
normally stay with the mother for the first two and a 
half years.
