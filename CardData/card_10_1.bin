LION 
The lion is the largest African carnivore. The native  
habitat of the lion is the wide savannah of central  
and southern Africa. This region's wide swaths of tall  
grasses provide excellent coverage for lions on the  
hunt, and the occasional tree provides shade for  
resting lions. The lion spends over 20 hours a day  
resting, usually in the shade of trees or rocks.  
However, the lion is a very athletic cat, capable of  
impressively long and high leaps. They are also  
terrific climbers. 
 
Unlike other large cats, lions are social in nature,  
living in prides of up to 40 animals, primarily  
females and cubs. Lions hunt both singly and in  
groups, although their success rate is much higher in  
groups. The lionesses do most of the hunting, while  
the male lions protect the pride from predators,
