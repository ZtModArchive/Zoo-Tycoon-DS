AFRICAN BUFFALO 
The African, or Cape, buffalo is the only African  
species of the large international Bovidae family,  
which includes the American bison and European  
domesticated cattle.  
 
The native habitat of the African buffalo is the  
savannah of central and southern Africa. Although  
these animals can survive under all sorts of  
conditions found within this region, their ideal  
habitat is an open area containing high grassy  
thickets and the occasional tree for cover, with access  
to a permanent supply of water and mud for  
wallowing. The buffalo grazes on a wide assortment  
of savannah grasses. Its long, prehensile tongue  
allows it to consume the taller, coarse grass usually  
avoided by other herd animals.
