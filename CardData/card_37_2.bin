IBEX
habitat. The ibex's keen senses of sight, hearing, and 
smell make it very alert to potential danger, which it 
escapes by climbing up into the rocks where few 
predators can safely venture. When cornered, it will 
defend itself with its large horns. 

Ibexes usually remain in the high, steep cliffs during 
the daytime, then descend to lower alpine meadows 
to feed during late afternoon and evening. During the 
winter, they move down the mountain in search of 
food. Their diet includes grass, moss, flowers, and the 
leaves and twigs of trees and small shrubs. A 
foraging ibex will often stand on its hind legs to reach 
leaves, twigs, and tender shoots. In the summer, 
ibexes need to drink every few days, so they prefer 
locations near permanent sources of water.
