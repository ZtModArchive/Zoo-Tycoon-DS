other animals upon which the hyena preys.  
Hyenas have a contentious relationship with most  
other animals on the African savannah. Generally,  
the hyenas are either trying to steal their food or kill

to kill hyenas; perhaps because it is not uncommon  
for a pack of hyenas to chase away lions from a fresh  
kill.
