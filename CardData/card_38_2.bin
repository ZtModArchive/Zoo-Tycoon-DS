AMERICAN BIGHORN SHEEP
yearlings, and lambs. Rams travel in small bands of 
their own, joining the females during the mating 
season.

Bighorn sheep are very alert and, in addition to 
possessing keen hearing and a good sense of smell, 
have remarkable vision that allows them to judge 
distances accurately when jumping and locating 
footholds. They can spot other animals moving from 
up to a mile away. Bighorn hooves are hard on the 
outside and soft on the inside, and so act as shock 
absorbers, contributing to the sheep's ability to 
rapidly scramble up rocky terrain.
