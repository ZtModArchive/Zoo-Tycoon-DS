ASIAN ELEPHANT
While female African elephants have well-developed 
tusks, their Asian counterparts do not. This is 
probably due to differences between the regions in 
which they are found. In Africa, the elephant's tusks 
help it to strip bark from trees and dig for scarce 
water, minerals, and roots. In Asia, where food is 
more plentiful, tusks are not as necessary for 
survival.

Elephants are highly intelligent animals, with a 
well-developed social system. Herds consist of 
between 15 and 30 related individuals, generally led 
by an older matriarch. Males are solitary, joining the 
herd only for the mating season. At this time, the bull 
elephants will battle fiercely, and sometimes fatally, 
for mating rights in the herd.
