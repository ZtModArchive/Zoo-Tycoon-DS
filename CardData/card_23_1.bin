GRAY WOLF 
As the largest member of the dog family, a gray wolf  
can weigh anywhere from 70 to 115 pounds and is  
bigger than the average German shepherd dog. The  
coat of the gray wolf can actually range in color from  
pure white to coal black. It is believed that all dogs  
are descended from Middle Eastern wolves that were  
tamed around 12,000 years ago.  

The gray wolf ranges worldwide, with populations in  
the United States, Canada, Europe, Asia, the Middle  
East, and Russia. Although gray wolves were once  
numerous across the North American continent,  
today they are found primarily in regions of northern  
Canada and parts of Mexico. There are fewer than  
2,500 wolves in the continental United States. These  
are mostly in the forested areas of Northern  
Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin.
