herd crosses into a solitary bull's territory, that bull  
will lead the herd through its land and then allow the  
next bull to take over at the boundary. At rest,  
related animals within a herd will often lie with their  
backs touching or with chins propped on each other's  
backs. In the open spaces of the African savannah,  
buffalo herds can often contain 500 to 2,000  
individuals. Because of their relatively large size and  
need for space, they are kept in much smaller groups

grunts and bellows during the mating season. On the
