KOUPREY
there are some males that can stay alone.  The male 
or elderly female will become a leader in the group.  
Kouprey often spend the daytime grazing in the open 
grassy area. At night, the animal will enter the forest 
in order to rest and seek protection from predators. 

When the animal was discovered in 1937, there 
were believed to be 2000 kouprey remaining.  The 
number further decreased until there were 
approximately 20 in Vietnam and 100 in Laos in 
protected preserves.  Just what caused this decline?

Hunting was one of the main causes.  Humans 
used the animal for food and sold its horns for money.  
Human encroachment also led to a reduction in 
habitat.  Still, there was another cause. War.
