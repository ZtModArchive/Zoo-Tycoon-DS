POLAR BEAR 
Polar bears are extremely smart. One researcher has
compared their intelligence to that of apes. In
captivity, in addition to the snow,ice, and deep water
they require, they respond well to more stimulating  
environments that also include areas of sand, grass,  
and hard ground. When not hunting, polar bears are  
playful creatures. When bored, agitated, or upset,  
polar bears will roar, pace, and swing their heads.
