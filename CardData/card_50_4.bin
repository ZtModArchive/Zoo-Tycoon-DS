ORANGUTANS
builds separate nests, but remain nearby until they 
are about 8 years old.

Male orangutans are territorial, claiming large areas 
of the rainforest, and any females found within, as 
their own. They use loud calls, amplified by the air 
sacs in their throats, to warn other males off their 
territory. Males will not hesitate to fight if their 
warnings are ignored.

Scientists estimate that only 25,000 orangutans are 
left in the wild. Poachers have killed or captured 
many of these great apes, while forest fires and 
logging have greatly decreased their habitats.
