OLIVE BABOON 
Olive baboons are capable of a wide range of  
vocalizations and also communicate with eye  
movements, facial expressions, and limb and tail  
movements. Males will threaten each other by  
audibly grinding their teeth at close quarters.  
Alarmed baboons will emit short, sharp yaks with  
their mouths wide open. 

Olive baboons have a robust population and are not  
currently threatened.
