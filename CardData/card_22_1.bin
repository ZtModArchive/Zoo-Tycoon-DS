GRIZZLY BEAR 
The mighty grizzly bear evolved about one million  
years ago, probably from the black bear family.  
Grizzlies, or brown bears, are one of the largest  
North American mammals. In some areas, male  
grizzlies can reach weights of up to 1,800 pounds, but  
those found in the lower 48 states do not generally  
weigh more than 600 pounds. The grizzly has a hump  
of muscle on its shoulders and thick, shaggy fur that  
is sometimes tipped with silver ends. This fur can be  
a variety of colors: black, cinnamon, red, or blond.  
The grizzly is not a climber. Instead, their claws are  
well adapted to digging for food, such as roots and  
rodents.  
 
Grizzly bears have the most widespread distribution  
of any of the eight bear species. They are found in  
North America and scattered across Eurasia.
