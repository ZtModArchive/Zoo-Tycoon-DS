BLACK BEAR 
The American black bear is one of eight species of  
bears found throughout the world. Although the  
majority of black bears are actually black, there is a  
range of color within this species, including white,  
blonde, cinnamon, and various shades of brown. They  
can weigh from 125 to 660 pounds, depending on food  
availability, with males averaging a third larger than  
females. These bears lack the distinct shoulder hump  
of the grizzly bear. 
 
The American black bear is the most widespread and  
numerous bear in North America, with a population  
estimated at somewhere between 400,000 and  
750,000. They are presently found in northern  
Mexico, 32 states of the United States, and nearly all  
of Canada. Although this animal is flexible in its  
habitat requirements, it prefers to live near streams
