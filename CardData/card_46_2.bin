UNICORN
tail similar to that of a lion. The unicorns most 
familiar to modern eyes are descendants of the 
European unicorn, and are larger, with white 
horse-like bodies. All subspecies of unicorn have a 
single horn, generally long and spiraled, protruding 
from the forehead. While the color of this horn varies 
depending on the subspecies, white or black horns 
are the most common.

The unicorn's horn is both the source of its mystique 
and the reason this animal is so scarce today. Even 
more than the horn of the rhinoceros, the unicorn's 
horn is valued by collectors for its alleged mystical 
powers and healing properties. Due to the 
long-standing belief that it can detect and neutralize 
poison, drinking vessels made from the unicorn's 
horn were greatly prized during the Middle Ages.
