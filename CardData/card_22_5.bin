GRIZZLY BEAR 
although cubs may fall prey to mountain lions,  
wolves, and other bears if they stray too far from  
their mother. In the United States, grizzlies are  
listed as threatened by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife  
Service. There are probably fewer than 1,000  
grizzlies left in the lower 48 states. Threats to the  
grizzly include habitat destruction, poaching, and the  
elimination of individuals that have become  
dangerous in populated areas and campgrounds.
