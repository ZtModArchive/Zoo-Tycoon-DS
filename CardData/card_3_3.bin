PLAINS ZEBRA 
An angry zebra looks and sounds very similar to a  
horse. It will buck and rear while making a distinct  
whistling noise. Because of their social nature, one  
angry zebra can quickly upset the rest of the herd. A  
happy zebra will often run and jump around its  
exhibit, in addition to lying contentedly in the sun.  
Zebras reproduce well in captivity.
