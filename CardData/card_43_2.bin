DROMEDARY CAMEL
dates, grass, wheat, and oats.

The camel is a semi-social animal, equally at home 
alone or with small groups of other camels. They 
prefer their own company and will often become 
agitated around unfamiliar animals. 

Camels have an ill-deserved reputation for being 
bad-tempered and obstinate creatures that spit and 
kick. In reality, they tend to be amiable, patient, and 
intelligent. A camel will show displeasure by 
stamping its feet and running.
