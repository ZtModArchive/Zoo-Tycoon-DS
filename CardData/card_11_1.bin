CHEETAH 
Cheetahs are unique cats found today primarily in  
sub-Saharan Africa, with small populations also  
existing in Iran and Russia. The oldest cheetah  
fossils, discovered in North America, date from about  
4 million years ago. This animal was common  
throughout Asia, Africa, Europe, and North America  
until about 10,000 years ago, when major climactic  
changes at the end of the last Ice Age caused many  
mammals to die out. Genetically, all cheetahs living  
today are as closely related as identical twins, which  
has led to the theory that the current cheetah  
population is descended from a single female and a  
few closely related males. This lack of genetic  
diversity makes the cheetah particularly vulnerable  
to disease.
