CHEETAH 
fastest land animal on earth. From top to bottom,  
this cat is built to run! Wide nostrils connected to a  
large set of lungs allow quick air intake. Its long,  
streamlined torso is built upon light bones, with its  
spine designed to work as a spring for the powerful  
back legs, giving the cheetah a longer stride. The  
long tail provides balance on high speed turns, and  
hard and narrow paw pads, coupled with cleat-like  
claws, provide great traction. Adult cheetahs weigh  
120 to 130 pounds. Their coats range from yellowish  
gray to reddish brown in color and are covered with  
small- to medium-sized black spots. Cheetahs' faces  
are patterned with black markings, resembling tears,  
that run from the inside of their eyes to their upper  
lips. 
 
Cheetahs can often be found in open savannah areas
