females. However, if danger threatens the troop, the  
adult males join forces, surrounding the females and  
children and snarling and barking at the threat.  
When facing predators such as leopards, olive  
baboons will mob them, often inflicting severe injury.  
Their main enemies are leopards, lions, hunting dogs,  
crocodiles, hyenas, jackals, great eagles, and python  
snakes. When they meet humans, baboons usually  
flee. However, if the baboons happen to be up a tree,  
the human intruders are usually greeted by a dung  
rain. 
 
To avoid nocturnal predators, olive baboons sleep on  
cliffs or in trees such as acacias. These animals spend  
most of their time on the ground during the day. They  
feed in the early morning and late evening, sitting on  
the ground and shuffling along as they forage.
