SNOW LEOPARD 
Snow leopards are a distinct species within the cat  
family, rather than a subspecies of leopard. They are  
found above the tree line and near permanent snow  
throughout the mountains of Central Asia, with  
small populations scattered throughout China,  
Bhutan, Nepal, India, Pakistan, Afghanistan,  
Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz  
Republic, Russia, and Mongolia. Throughout most of  
their range, snow leopards are found along major  
ridgelines, bluff edges, gullies, and broken cliffs  
within arid and semi-arid grass and scrub regions.  
 
It is difficult to estimate how many snow leopards  
remain in the wild, since they inhabit very rugged  
terrain and possess excellent camouflage, but the  
population probably ranges from 3,500 to 7,500  
individuals. They are considered endangered.
