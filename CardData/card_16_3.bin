AFRICAN WARTHOG 
quite good at digging, warthogs use holes excavated  
by aardvarks for their burrows. The hogs enter these  
burrows backward, with their heads facing the  
opening, which enables them to use their tusks  
against invaders. In the morning, they burst out of  
their burrows at high speed to try and avoid any  
predators that may be lying in wait.  

Warthogs are preyed upon by many African  
carnivores, including spotted hyenas, wild dogs,  
cheetahs, lions, leopards, and eagles. When  
threatened, warthogs will retreat to their burrows if  
possible. In a fight, however, warthogs are able to  
defend themselves by using their lower canine teeth  
to great advantage. 
 
Like all pig species, warthogs are very social animals.
