ARCTIC WOLF
growls, howls, whimpers, whines, and barks. A single, 
subtle body movement can express volumes. A wolf 
will flatten its ears against the side of its head when 
afraid, and bare its teeth when angry. Subordination 
is shown by lowering body and tail, or by rolling on 
the back. A playful wolf will dance around and lower 
the front part of its body, leaving the back part 
raised.

After mating in March, the pregnant female leaves 
the pack to find a den in which to give birth. The cubs 
are born deaf, blind, and helpless. They are totally 
dependent on their mother, and she in turn relies on 
her mate to bring her food. All the adults in the pack 
cooperate in feeding and caring for the cubs. By the 
following year, they may be ready to leave the pack.
