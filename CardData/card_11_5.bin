CHEETAH 
hidden for the first month. Although cheetahs have  
reproductive difficulties, probably stemming from  
inbreeding, a successful pregnancy in the wild  
usually results in a large litter, with three to five  
cubs being average, and as many as eight possible. In  
captivity, possibly due to stress factors, litter sizes  
are much smaller, with one or two being average. In  
the wild, cheetah cubs have an estimated 75%  
mortality rate. Lions will go out of their way to kill  
cheetah cubs. 
 
Cheetahs are generally unhappy in captivity. They do  
not like crowds and require larger than average  
habitats, containing no more than three cheetahs. 
 
Cheetahs are an endangered species, with an  
estimated remaining population of between 9,000
