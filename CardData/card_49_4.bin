KOUPREY
The Vietnam War continued for over 10 years.  
After intense bombing and chemical deforestation, 
the forest that provided the kouprey with its habitat 
was decimated.  After the Vietnam War ended, civil 
war continued.  Soldiers hunted large animals such 
as the kouprey as a source of food.  

When war occurs, many people are injured, die, or 
lose their homes.  Animals also face the same fate.  
War affects all living creatures where it occurs.

There are no kouprey currently in captivity.  
Scientists haven't even observed this animal since 
1957! In order to protect this animal, it will be 
necessary to further our knowledge about its lifestyle.  
Unfortunately, it is uncertain even as to whether this 
animal still exists.
