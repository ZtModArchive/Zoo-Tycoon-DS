GIANT ANTEATER 
during the breeding season. A female giant anteater  
gives birth to one baby each year. The mother carries  
her offspring on her back for up to a year, even  
though a baby anteater is capable of a slow gallop one  
month after birth.   
 
Anteaters have an excellent sense of smell, which  
they use to locate their prey. They also have good  
hearing but terrible eyesight. They will sleep up to 15  
hours a day. While sleeping, they cover themselves  
with their long, fanlike tails. Depending on the  
temperature and the humidity of the area, these  
animals may be active both day and night.  
 
The principal predators of the anteater are members  
of the cat family, such as the puma and the jaguar,  
but humans pose the greatest danger to this
