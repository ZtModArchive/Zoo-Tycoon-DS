deaths every year. 
Although this species was hunted almost to 
extinction in the late 1960s, the future of the 
saltwater crocodile seems very secure today, given 
the large populations existing in Australia and 
Papua New Guinea. However, it is likely that the 
salty's range will be reduced through the elimination 
of many small populations elsewhere. Loss of human 
life has led to animosity towards the species, making 
conservation difficult.
