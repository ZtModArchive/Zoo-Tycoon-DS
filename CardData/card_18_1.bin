AMERICAN BISON 
The American bison, sometimes referred to as the  
American buffalo, once comprised the largest  
community of wild animals in the history of the world.  
By one estimate, there were sixty million bison in  
North America when Columbus landed. During the  
late 1800s, millions of these animals were wantonly  
slaughtered, bringing them to the verge of extinction.  
Today, bison live only in parks and reserves or in  
privately-owned herds across the United States and  
Canada. Bison herds today usually contain about 60  
individuals: a mix of cows, calves, and young adults.  
Adult males range singly or in smaller groups. 
 
The more common variety of bison, the plains bison,  
is by definition a creature of the grassland. These  
animals thrive on a variety of grasses. In captivity,  
bison are generally fed alfalfa, hay, or grain pellets.
