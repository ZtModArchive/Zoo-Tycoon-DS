AFRICAN BUFFALO 
mph, buffalo are capable of outrunning a pursuing  
lion, but can be ambushed in spite of this since it is  
difficult for them to get up to speed quickly. Only  
lions are capable of bringing down a healthy adult  
buffalo, and even then they run a considerable risk of  
being treed, gored, or trampled by an enraged herd.
