ASIAN ELEPHANT
and in climates ranging from very wet to very dry. 
They prefer areas that combine grass, low woody 
plants, and forest. At one time, elephants migrated 
seasonally, but agricultural development has 
interfered with their ability to wander freely between 
regions. An ideal habitat for an Asian elephant is on 
the fringes of a tropical rainforest, where there is an 
abundance of water and a plentiful supply of food. 
Although grasses make up a large percentage of their 
diet, they will also eat leaves, bark, stems and fruits. 
Acacia and palm trees are favorites, as are mangoes, 
bananas, coconuts and berries. As elephants have 
inefficient digestive systems, utilizing only about 
50% of their food intake, they need to eat a great deal. 
In captivity, their exhibits tend to need a lot of 
cleaning!
