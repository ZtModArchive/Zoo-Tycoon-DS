CLOUDED LEOPARD 
Clouded leopards prefer privacy and do not generally  
thrive in captivity. Modern zoos may try to  
accommodate these animals' needs by leaving only  
one side of their exhibits open for viewing. The  
clouded leopard also requires hiding places within its  
exhibit, as well as various places for climbing. In  
general, this animal does not like open space.  
Enrichment items such as balls and other toys can  
also benefit clouded leopards.
