BENGAL TIGER 
tropical forests. Tigers will take advantage of  
human-made trails and roads.  
 
Although not very good at climbing, the Bengal tiger  
is a good swimmer and can commonly be seen wading  
in pools to cool off. They are slow runners, but are  
very skilled at the stealthy stalking of prey, which  
they hunt mostly at night.  
 
In captivity, tigers tend to be lazy beasts, spending  
the majority of their time lounging in the sun. Tigers  
tend to get loud when they are angry.
