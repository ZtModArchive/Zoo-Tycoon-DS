THOMSON'S GAZELLE 
The Thomson's gazelle, or @tommy,@ is a small  
antelope found in Tanzania, Kenya, and the southern  
Sudan. This species mainly congregates in the open  
grassy plains where there is abundant food and  
enough space to range freely. Large numbers of these  
animals migrate together following the rains.  
 
The Thomson's gazelle is one of three migratory  
animals that dominate the East African plains.  
Gazelles have an affinity for their fellow migratory  
herd animals-the plains zebra and the wildebeest-as  
well as for the giraffe. Thomson's gazelles generally  
gather in loosely affiliated herds that can vary widely  
in size. During migration, herds can number in the  
thousands. Because gazelles travel in large herds,  
they are most comfortable in close proximity to each  
other. As a result, small herds are able to exist
