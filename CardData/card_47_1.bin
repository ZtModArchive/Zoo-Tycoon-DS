ASIAN ELEPHANT
The Asian elephant differs from its cousin, the 
African elephant, in several ways. Asian elephants 
are smaller, with males reaching up to 20 feet in 
length, 10 feet in height, and 12,000 lbs. in weight. 
They have smaller ears, more rounded backs, 
smoother skin, and an extra toenail on each foot. 
Their heads have two domes, rather than one, and 
only the males grow large tusks. The ends of their 
trunks also differ; whereas the African elephant has 
two projections, which it can use like fingers to grasp 
objects, the Asian elephant has only a single 
projection, requiring it to curl its trunk around 
anything it wants to pick up.

Asian elephants are scattered across southern Asia, 
from the Himalayas to Borneo. They live in all sorts 
of habitats, being found at widely different elevations
