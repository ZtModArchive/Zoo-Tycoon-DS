ASIAN ELEPHANT
Elephants communicate using a number of different 
sounds. An agitated or angry elephant will trumpet 
loudly. While feeding, elephants make a purring 
sound. Many sounds made by elephants are too low 
for the human ear to detect.

Baby elephants are born after a year and a half 
gestation, and are soon able to stand and follow their 
mothers. They may nurse from their own mother, or 
from other lactating females in the herd. Although 
able to eat grass after a few months, elephant calves 
will continue nursing for about 18 months. Males 
leave the herd when they become sexually mature, at 
about 14 years of age. Elephants are slow and 
difficult to breed, bearing only about four young 
during their lives. Elephants live for about 70 years.
