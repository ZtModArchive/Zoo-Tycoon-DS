IBEX
During the breeding season, the male ibexes perform 
fight rituals to win mature females. The strongest 
males with the longest horns win the right to breed 
with the available females. In these battles, the male 
ibexes generally do not injure each other.

In captivity, an angry ibex may trot or run agitatedly 
around its enclosure, bleating, jerking its head, and 
possibly bucking.

The alpine ibex lives in herds consisting of adult 
females and their young. Males are usually solitary, 
coming together with the females only during the 
breeding season. In the wild, herd size is generally 
between 10 to 20 animals. Young ibexes live with 
their mothers until they reach maturity, at which 
time the males strike off on their own.
