CHIMPANZEE 
Chimps are our closest living relatives. In  
appearance, they somewhat resemble monkeys, but  
lack tails and facial hair. They have long arms with  
opposable thumbs and are able to use tools. Chimps  
are extremely intelligent animals; in captivity they  
have been taught to communicate using sign  
language. Observations of these animals in their  
native habitat show that chimpanzees exhibit  
culture: different bands of chimps display variations  
in acquired skills and habits.  
 
The native setting of the chimpanzee is the tropical  
rainforests of central and western Africa. The large  
trees and dense vegetation of this region generally  
allow little light to reach the forest floor, and only the  
occasional clearing allows grass to flourish.  
Chimpanzees prefer to spend their time in and
