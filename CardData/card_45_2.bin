CALIFORNIA SEA LION
crests on their heads at about five years of age. Sea 
lions have large front and rear flippers that they use 
to walk on land. 

California sea lions are known for their intelligence, 
playfulness, and noisy barking. Sea lions have loud 
roars, which help explain their name. Trained sea 
lions are frequently found in zoos and aquaria. These 
creatures can remain submerged for up to 15 minutes 
and can reach swimming speeds of up to 25 mph for 
short bursts. They frequently dive to depths of 360 
feet, with recorded dives of 800 feet. Sea lions have 
been observed leaping out of the water like porpoises 
and surfing breaking waves.

Unlike most other marine mammals, sea lions can 
live for long periods both in the ocean and on land.
