OSTRICH 
the dry savannah regions of Africa. These birds  
prefer flat, open areas with low rainfall. Ostriches get  
water from the plants they eat and can go without  
water for long periods of time. However, they are very  
fond of water and will take baths when given the  
chance.  
 
These birds eat a wide variety of nutritious shoots,  
succulent plants, roots, seeds, stemmed flowers,  
leaves, and fruits, as well as lizards, snakes, young  
birds, small mammals, and some insects. An ostrich  
in captivity requires 7.5 lbs of food per day. Ostriches  
will swallow small stones with their food to aid in  
digestion. Salt is poisonous to ostriches. 
 
Usually the ostrich can be found living with flocks of  
other grazing animals, such as antelopes and zebras.
