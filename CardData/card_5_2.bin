THOMSON'S GAZELLE 
contentedly in smaller exhibits in captivity than one  
might expect.  
 
The gazelle is an efficient grazing animal that can  
eat the shorter grasses other animals ignore. Ninety  
percent of its diet is made up of young, tender grasses  
and scrub. When grass is unavailable, tommies may  
also browse on low hanging branches and bushes. 
 
The Thomson's gazelle has a great number of  
predators and relies exclusively on flight to escape  
from danger. As a result, it is very good at fleeing:  
able to leap 10 feet into the air, bound 30 feet at a  
time, and turn more quickly than a cheetah. The  
tommy is the second fastest animal in Africa. When it  
reaches its top speed of 49 to 50 mph, only the  
cheetah is able to outpace it.
