GIANT PANDA
solitary nature, make it quite important that pandas 
have adequate space. A cramped exhibit will cause 
the animal great distress. A permanent source of 
fresh drinking water is also necessary to the panda's 
comfort. Pandas have less tolerance for captivity 
than other animals.

A panda expends much of its energy eating. Pandas 
also enjoy climbing on rocks. The rest of its time is 
spent mostly sleeping and resting. An agitated panda 
will often growl and swing its paw. A happy panda 
makes soft yipping noises and may even do a 
somersault.
