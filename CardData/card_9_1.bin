HIPPOPOTAMUS 
@Hippopotamus@ is the Greek word for @river-horse,@  
a name that aptly describes these large, semi-aquatic  
mammals. On land, this animal is second only to the  
elephant in size, and the size of its mouth is second  
only to that of the whale. Unique among land  
animals, the hippo can open its jaw a full 180 degrees,  
thereby creating its distinctive yawn.  

Hippos can be found in the lakes, rivers, and swamps  
of sub-Saharan Africa. They are voracious grazers  
and need large, open areas of mixed grasses to supply  
their dietary needs. In their natural setting, these  
animals will typically range two to three miles  
during their solitary nightly foraging, and so are  
more comfortable when placed in larger zoo exhibits.  
In captivity, a hippo diet might include hay and an  
assortment of lettuce, carrots, cabbage, watermelon,
