POLAR BEAR
Beneath their fur, their skin is actually black. Polar 
bears work hard to keep their fur clean. After feeding, 
they will head immediately for water to wash off. 
paws, chests, and muzzles.

Seals are the favorite food of polar bears. Their 
hunting technique relies more on stealth than on 
agility. A polar bear will lie patiently on the ice 
waiting for a seal to surface for air or will lunge 
suddenly out of the water to surprise a seal on the ice. 
They are often hungry. Their large stomachs allow 
them to eat huge amounts when food is available so 
that they can go for weeks between meals if necessary. 
In captivity, polar bears consume a steady diet of fish 
and dried foods. Polar bears require a source of fresh 
water.
