RED KANGAROO 
Baby kangaroos are bean-sized when born. The tiny,  
hairless embryo makes its way across the mother's  
belly into the pouch, where it attaches itself to one of  
the four available teats. Once nursing begins, the  
teat swells up so that the baby will remain attached.  
The joey will remain in the pouch for 5 to 6 months as  
it continues to mature. After that, it will be fully  
developed and can emerge to explore. Joeys are  
usually weaned around one year of age, but will  
remain close to the mother for another six months.  
 
Kangaroos are so well-designed for hopping that they  
are unable to walk. They have large, powerful hind  
feet that cannot move independently of each other  
and a tendon in their legs that behaves like a rubber  
band, conserving energy as they move. Red  
kangaroos can hop as fast as 40 mph, making leaps
