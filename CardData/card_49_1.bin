KOUPREY
The kouprey is considered to be one of the 
world's most endangered animals. It is also one of
the world's most peculiar animals. In fact, it has
hardly even been seen. The current estimated number of 
kouprey is said to be 250 and declining.

It was not discovered by science until 1937 in the 
forests of Cambodia.  Although the animal has 
existed for a very long time, there are only four 
countries this animal can be found in. The kouprey 
inhabits four Southeast Asian countries including 
Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, and Thailand.  

Among all animals discovered after the 
twentieth century, the kouprey was the largest. The 
height from the ground to the animal's shoulder 
when it is walking on all fours is around 150-190 cm.
