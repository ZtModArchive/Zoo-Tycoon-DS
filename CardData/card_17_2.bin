RED KANGAROO 
social groupings, called mobs. Although the makeup  
of a mob can vary, it will commonly contain a  
dominant male, several adult females, and young of  
both sexes. Mothers and young can remain together  
for years.  
 
Kangaroos are able to survive high temperatures by  
seeking shade during the day and feeding at night. In  
the wild, their diet consists of green grass, leaves,  
and roots. They swallow their food whole, later  
regurgitating a cud and chewing it. In the wild, this  
animal does not need continual access to fresh water,  
as long as green herbage is available. When  
necessary, they will dig for water. In zoos, kangaroos  
are fed a diet that typically includes fruit, yams,  
bread, monkey-dog-guinea pig chow, and vitamin  
supplements.
