PLAINS ZEBRA 
can be found in areas containing tall grasses,  
interspersed with areas of dirt and sand, and broken  
by the occasional stands of acacias and the large  
African baobab tree. Too many trees will make zebras  
nervous, as they prefer open areas where they can  
see predators approaching. Zebras require the  
presence of a dependable water source such as a  
waterhole, since these animals need to drink fairly  
often. 
 
Zebras are comfortable with their fellow herd  
animals, such as the Thomson's gazelle, the  
wildebeest, and even the giraffe. Large predators,  
such as the lion and the hyena, will cause a zebra  
herd to flee. On rare occasions, a zebra stallion has  
been known to try and save a young zebra from these  
fearsome predators.
