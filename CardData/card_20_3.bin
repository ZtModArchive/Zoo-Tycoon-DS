MOOSE 
much as 130 pounds a day.  
 
Moose have poor vision, which is compensated for by  
acute hearing and smell. They are swift runners,  
reaching speeds of up to 35 miles an hour. They are  
also excellent swimmers and can dive a considerable  
depth, having valvular nostrils, which seal upon  
submergence.  
 
Moose are solitary animals, except during the rutting  
season. The strongest social bond is between mother  
and young. They do not like crowding. They will  
generally avoid humans, but can be unpredictable  
and dangerous under certain conditions. For instance,  
cows with calves and rutting bulls have been known  
to charge people, cars, horses, and even locomotives.
