MOOSE 
The majestic moose is the largest member of the deer  
family, measuring up to 7.5 feet in height. They can  
be found throughout the northern forests of North  
America, Europe, and Russia. Male moose (bulls) are  
much larger than female moose (cows); a large bull  
can weigh up to twice as much as a typical cow.  
During most of the year, the bull is distinguished by a  
magnificent set of antlers, having an average spread  
of 4 to 5 feet and as many as 30 tines. The shape of  
these antlers is unique to the individual. Mature  
males shed their antlers once a year in the winter  
and replace them with larger ones. Other  
characteristics of the moose include large muscular  
shoulders, a @bell@ or dewlap of skin under the chin, a  
drooping nose, long legs, and a small tail.  
 
Moose are a very hardy and adaptable species,
