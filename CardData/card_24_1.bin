MANDRILL 
Biologist Charles Darwin called the mandrill the  
most vividly colored specimen in mammaldom. These  
large monkeys have white eyelids, blue cheeks, red  
noses, yellow beards, and lilac-colored rumps. Male  
mandrills are twice the size of females, ranging  
between 50 and 90 pounds, and their colorful  
markings become much brighter when they reach  
sexual maturity. Their size and their long canine  
teeth make the adult male mandrill the most  
formidable of any monkey. 
 
Mandrills are found in the thick evergreen  
rainforests of central West Africa, from Cameroon to  
Gabon and New Guinea. They prefer areas with a  
supply of drinking water and little ground cover.  
Their home range is about 115 miles, the largest  
known for any primate.
