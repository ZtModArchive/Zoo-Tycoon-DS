with their flippers while twisting and turning over. 

Emperor penguins communicate with calls and 
through a range of ritual displays, such as head and 
flipper waving, bowing, gesturing, and preening. 
Aggressive postures like stares, pointing, and 
charging can occur in disputes over territory. A 
simple threat call is used to warn against predators.

Emperor penguins have no predators on land and so 
are fairly fearless around humans. In water, their 
black and white coloring makes them nearly invisible 
to predators from both above and below. The chief 
predator for adult penguins is the leopard seal. The 
giant petrel accounts for about a third of emperor 
chick mortality.
