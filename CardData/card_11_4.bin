day and are rarely active at night. Although these  
cats cannot roar, they have a distinctive chirping,  
bird-like call, and are capable of other sounds  
ranging from growls and barks to bleats. Cheetahs,

than lone cheetahs. Female cheetahs avoid contact  
with other adult cheetahs except to mate.  
 
Cheetahs give birth in cover and keep their cubs
