SIBERIAN TIGER 
Tigers depend on their sight and hearing more than  
on their sense of smell to locate prey. They hunt at  
night, stalking slowly and stealthily through dense  
cover until they are close enough to spring. They kill  
their prey by using their canines to bite the throat or  
neck. Siberian tigers will then hide their kill, and are  
capable of dragging a weight that a dozen men would  
have difficulty moving. 
 
Tigers are excellent swimmers. They will often  
escape the heat of the day by lying in pools of water.  
They may also rest in long grass or rocky caves.  
Although these tigers do not have the stamina for  
long, swift runs, they are capable of covering huge  
distances. One Siberian tiger traveled 620 miles in 22  
days in search of food.
