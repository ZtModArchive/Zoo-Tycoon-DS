JAGUAR 
The jaguar ranks after the lion and the tiger in size,  
making it the third largest cat in the world. In  
appearance, the jaguar greatly resembles the leopard,  
although it is larger and stockier in build, with a  
shorter tail. Another way to differentiate between the  
two species is by the pattern of the coat: the jaguar's  
markings consist of dark rings surrounding a lighter  
area containing several dark spots. As with leopards,  
there are also black jaguars. 
 
In the wild, the easiest way to distinguish between  
the jaguar and the leopard is location. The jaguar  
lives in Central and South America.  These cats  
prefer a dense rainforest habitat, such as is found in  
the Amazon Basin. They require a plentiful supply of  
fresh water.
