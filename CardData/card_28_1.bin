WHITE BENGAL TIGER 
All known white tigers are descendents of a white  
Bengal tiger named @Mohan,@ captured in 1951 in  
India. The white coloration is the result of a double  
recessive gene. The white tigers are not albinos; they  
have chocolate stripes and blue eyes, although  
several variations in eye and stripe color have been  
seen. White Bengal tigers are extremely rare in the  
wild: no sightings of white tigers have been reported  
in India since the capture of Mohan, and only about a  
dozen sightings were reported in the 50 years before  
that.  
 
The Bengal tiger is the only subspecies of tiger to  
carry the recessive gene for the white color. Mohan  
was first bred to a normally colored Bengal tiger, and  
then bred to one of his normally colored daughters.  
This resulted in the first white tiger cubs to be born
