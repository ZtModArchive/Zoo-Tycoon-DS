CHIMPANZEE 
In captivity, chimpanzees will generally become  
upset when placed in a exhibit with other species,  
especially if these happen to be large carnivores. An  
agitated chimpanzee tends to be extremely vocal,  
expressing its displeasure by hooting and hollering.  
One angry chimp can set off the entire group.
