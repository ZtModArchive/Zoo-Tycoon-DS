GIRAFFE 
upset, giraffes may grunt or snort. Unhappy giraffes  
will also run or gallop about, and lower their heads  
into an almost horizontal position. An alarmed  
giraffe will stretch its head to its highest position. An  
angry or nervous individual will affect the other  
giraffes in its herd.  Giraffe calves enjoy playing and  
will race around their mothers or gambol with other  
calves. Giraffes tend to reproduce infrequently in  
captivity.
