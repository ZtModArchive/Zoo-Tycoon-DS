MANDRILL 
leaves, insects, fruit, bark, grass, fungi, and small  
animals. Mandrills have cheek pouches that can hold  
a substantial quantity of food, leaving their hands  
and feet free for running and climbing. At night,  
mandrills sleep in trees. 
Large groups of mandrills are very noisy and emit a  
continuous chorus of two-phase barks, frequent  
@crowing,@ grunts, and squeals. Females and young  
use a call to locate each other and a call of alarm  
when they feel threatened. A mandrill's coloring gets  
brighter when it becomes excited or angry. Male  
mandrills present a threat by @yawning,@ thereby  
fully exposing their long canines. A slight revealing of  
the teeth, possibly accompanied by teeth chattering,  
communicates a greeting, general friendliness, and a  
sense of well-being. 
The primary predator of the mandrill is the leopard.
