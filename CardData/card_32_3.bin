JAGUAR 
enemies other than man. Listed as endangered, there  
are approximately only 15,000 jaguars left in the  
wild, although numbers are difficult to verify. The  
jaguar is hunted for its fur, and is also killed by  
farmers fearing for the safety of their livestock.  
Another major threat to the jaguar is the habitat  
destruction resulting from deforestation.
