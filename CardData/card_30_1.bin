BLACK LEOPARD 
Melanistic, or black, leopards, also known as black  
panthers, are not a separate subspecies of leopard,  
but rather a color variation within the species. Black  
leopards have very dark brown background fur  
against which their black spots do not show very well,  
although they are still visible under bright light.  
Among the big cats, the leopard is most likely to  
produce melanistic individuals. 
 
Black leopards appear among many of the leopard  
populations, especially in areas such as Southeast  
Asia where low light conditions create a competitive  
advantage for the darker coloring. The gene for the  
dark coloring is recessive, so that two black leopards  
will have dark offspring, but two normally colored  
parents who both carry the recessive gene can often  
have black cubs appear among their spotted
