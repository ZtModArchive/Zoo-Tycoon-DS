HIPPOPOTAMUS 
miles per hour in an emergency. 
Hippos are herd animals and, in captivity, are  
comfortable in groups of between two and ten  
individuals. Adult hippos are generally safe from  
most carnivores because of their size; however,  
immature hippopotami can be vulnerable to  
aggressive predators such as lions, hyenas, and  
crocodiles. Mother hippopotami are fiercely  
protective of their young and have been known to  
snap an adult crocodile in two with their huge jaws.  
 
Hippos tend to reproduce infrequently in captivity.
