AMERICAN BISON 
bison have massive heads, which are not only  
equipped with lethal horns, but are also effective as  
battering rams. As if this arsenal were not enough, a  
bison's hind legs can also be used to kill or maim any  
animal perceived to be a threat. Grizzly bears and  
cougars were once formidable foes of the bison, but  
are now relatively uncommon in the areas where  
bison dwell today. Young, old, or sick bison may still  
be preyed upon by wolves, however. 
 
Bison at rest may be seen rolling and wallowing.   
Wallows created by bison are shallow, dust-filled  
depressions, and were once a common feature of the  
plains where bison roamed in large numbers.
