ORANGUTANS
and females have exceptionally flexible bodies, which 
allow them to travel through the treetops with ease.

The bulk of an orangutan's diet comes from the trees 
in which they make their homes. Orangutans 
consume a great deal of leaves, bark and fruit, but 
they are not entirely herbivorous. They will eat eggs, 
termites, and even small monkeys, especially when 
other foods are not readily available during the 
winter monsoon season.

Certain members of the large cat family are known to 
hunt orangutans. Lighter female orangutans often 
hide from predators in the treetops, but the clouded 
leopard can attack them even there.

The orangutan is only found on the islands of Borneo
