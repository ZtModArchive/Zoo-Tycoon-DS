CHIMPANZEE 
the time ordinarily spent foraging for social activities,  
such as playing, grooming, and other interactions.  
Scattered rocks found in their rainforest habitat  
provide many opportunities for fun to the playful  
chimpanzee. 
 
Chimpanzees are highly social animals that do not  
like to be isolated from their own kind. In their  
native forests, they travel in groups usually  
numbering between six to ten individuals. The males  
of a group will often engage in noisy dominance  
displays. Female chimps mate with many males  
during their fertile periods and bear a single  
offspring every three to eight years. Young  
chimpanzees travel by clinging to their mothers'  
backs.
